# PowerBI-CaseStudy-2: UFO Sightings

## Overview
This report presents an analysis of UFO sightings data from 1980 to 2015. By examining the available visualizations, we aim to discern patterns and generate hypotheses that could inform future studies.

## Data Insights

### Temporal Trends
The data indicates a notable increase in UFO sightings reports starting from the early 2000s, with a peak around 2012 before a subsequent decrease. This pattern suggests a variable rate of reporting over the years which could be influenced by external factors.

### Duration of Sightings
Most sightings are reported to last less than 10 minutes. The prevalence of brief encounters could have several explanations, including the transient nature of the phenomena or observer-related factors.

### Shape Categorization
The bar chart illustrates that sightings are most commonly reported as "light", "triangle", and "circle" shapes, among others. The variety of reported shapes suggests a complex classification challenge and warrants a closer look at the categorization criteria.

### Geographic Distribution
A concentration of sightings in the United States is evident, with a smaller number of reports from Canada and other regions. This distribution may reflect reporting biases or genuine areas of increased activity.

### Temporal Filters
The application of monthly and time-based filters provides an opportunity to examine potential seasonal or time-specific trends in sightings data.

## Concluding Remarks
The initial analysis of UFO sightings data opens several avenues for further research. The exploration of temporal and geographic trends, alongside the classification of sightings by shape, can provide a foundational understanding of the reporting patterns. This case study serves as a stepping stone for more detailed investigations into the UFO sightings phenomena.
